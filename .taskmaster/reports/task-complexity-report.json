			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down “Setup Project Repository” into 6 granular subtasks that cover: Git initialization, TypeScript configuration, dependency installation, esbuild setup, GitHub Actions workflow, and validation. For each subtask, specify objective, acceptance criteria, and required tooling.",
			"reasoning": "Standard scaffolding work with clear tooling; limited algorithmic depth but multiple configuration areas."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement CLI Integration Layer",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose “Implement CLI Integration Layer” into 7 subtasks including process spawning wrapper, streaming parser, error handling, debounce polling, configuration injection, unit tests with mocks, and documentation. Provide precise interfaces and test cases for each piece.",
			"reasoning": "Requires async process control, streaming JSON parsing, configurability, and robust testing, increasing both technical and edge-case complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Task Tree View",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split “Develop Task Tree View” into 6 subtasks: data model mapping, TreeDataProvider implementation, UI rendering logic, collapsible dependency handling, live refresh mechanics, and unit/UI tests with mock data.",
			"reasoning": "Involves UI state management, VS Code API usage, and hierarchical data rendering with dynamic updates."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Add Interactive Node Commands",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide “Add Interactive Node Commands” into 5 subtasks covering: command registration, PRD opener, terminal show, completion toggle with tree refresh, and integration tests for all commands.",
			"reasoning": "Command wiring is straightforward but touches multiple APIs and requires state synchronization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Status Bar & Telemetry",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break “Implement Status Bar & Telemetry” into 5 subtasks: status bar component, next-task retrieval, telemetry collector, real-time display logic, and performance/usage tests.",
			"reasoning": "Combines UI element, external data retrieval, and live metrics display; moderate complexity and cross-cutting concerns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Settings UI",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create 4 subtasks for “Create Settings UI”: configuration schema design, VS Code settings registration, UI exposure, and persistence/validation tests.",
			"reasoning": "Mostly declarative configuration with minimal custom logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Ensure Security and Compliance",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand “Ensure Security and Compliance” into 6 subtasks: threat model creation, runtime-security enforcement, untrusted workspace restrictions, package signing setup, CI verification, and compliance audit documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Requires deep understanding of security best practices, marketplace policies, and CI/CD integrations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Performance and Reliability",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose “Optimize Performance and Reliability” into 6 subtasks: performance benchmarking, tree rendering optimization, caching mechanism, error-handling strategy, resource monitoring instrumentation, and stress tests.",
			"reasoning": "Performance tuning and resilience demand profiling, algorithmic improvements, and rigorous testing under load."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Prepare for Marketplace Release",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split “Prepare for Marketplace Release” into 5 subtasks: documentation finalization, end-to-end testing, versioning & changelog, vsce packaging, and publication checklist review.",
			"reasoning": "Encompasses several coordinated but procedural steps to meet marketplace standards and release quality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Add Analyze Complexity Button",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the 'Analyze Complexity' button into specific development tasks, such as API integration, UI design, and performance optimization.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves integrating a new button into the existing task management interface, connecting it to a backend function, and ensuring efficient performance and user-friendly feedback. Given the multiple components and dependencies, a complexity score of 7 is appropriate. The task has already been divided into five subtasks covering API exposure, UI addition, click handling, results display, and performance optimization, which aligns with the recommended number of subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Prompt User for Research Option in Analyze Complexity",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the user prompt into detailed steps, including UI design, integration with the analyze-complexity function, and handling user responses.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple components: designing a user-friendly prompt, selecting an appropriate UI component (modal dialog or notification banner), integrating the prompt into the existing function, providing relevant research resources, and handling user responses. Each component requires careful consideration to ensure seamless integration and a positive user experience."
